Observation:
The global average per capita CO₂ emissions have steadily increased from the 19th century to the mid-20th century, with a significant rise during the industrial revolution. After peaking in the 1960s–1980s, emissions have shown fluctuations but no clear decline, highlighting the ongoing reliance on fossil fuels.
Implication:
The rapid increase during the industrial era correlates with industrialization and urbanization. Despite advancements in renewable energy, global emissions remain a pressing issue.
